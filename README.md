#### About
- [x] 😎 ~~I’m currently working on [King Typer](https://github.com/Vyctor661/king-typer) and [Codify](https://github.com/Vyctor661/Codify) but mainly on [King Typer](https://github.com/Vyctor661/king-typer)~~ ~~Well I want to start learning C# now and making a game as a side project so wish me gl;~~

- [x] 📫 How to reach me: Well you can reach me via discord ([Vyctor661#2132](https://discordapp.com/users/270972671490129921)) I'm spending most of my time on there with my amazing community but you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Vyctor661) sometimes (ᴡᴏᴜʟᴅɴ'ᴛ ᴍɪɴᴅ ᴀ ғᴏʟʟᴏᴡ ʜᴇʀᴇ ᴇɪᴛʜᴇʀ ʜᴇʜ);

- [x] 💻 For now my main goal is to master frontend and backend. Yes, it's not easy, but I am getting close. I mainly use TypeScript, React, Node, Webpack, Koa, Knex, PostgreSql and more, well you can always check out my repos to see what technologies I use. 

- [x] ⚡ Well it's hard to learn about a person just from some description on a profile, if you want to get to know me better just contact me and we can talk. 😁;
