### Hi there my name is Sandu Victor and this is my github profile. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

#### About
- [x] Worked on many projects, will work on many more and learn a lot more, currently the project I am proudest of is Codify, a discord bot. 

- [x] How to reach me: Well you can reach me via discord ([Vyctor661](https://discordapp.com/users/270972671490129921)) I'm spending most of my time on there but you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Vyctor661) sometimes.
