### About me
- You can see my most important projects in the pins list down below. 
- You can reach me via discord ([vycdev](https://discordapp.com/users/270972671490129921)) I'm spending most of my time on there but you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vycdev) sometimes.
- I am very familiar with frontend technologies, and a little bit of backend. I'm mostly familiar with: TypeScript, React, Node, Prisma, Knex, Koa, and more, but I have tried other unrelated things in the past too, like: C, C++, Purescript, Python. I will be able to learn anything very fast.
