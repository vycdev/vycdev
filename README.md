### About me
- You can see some of my projects in the pins list down below. 
- You can reach me via [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/270972671490129921) I'm spending most of my time on there but you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vycdev) sometimes.
- Technologies that I'm most familiar with: TypeScript/JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Prisma, Knex, Koa, as well as C, C++, Python, and PureScript. I am a fast learner.
